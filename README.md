Fluid Reach Marketing Support App

Project Overview

The AI Marketing Support App is a native iOS application built with SwiftUI designed to assist digital marketers and small business owners. It provides tools for goal tracking, educational resources, profile management, and features a simulation for human support, all integrated into a modern, easy-to-use mobile experience.

A core feature is the Sustainability Tracker, which visualizes the environmental impact score of campaigns over time using the native Swift Charts framework, encouraging responsible marketing practices.

âœ¨ Key Features
Sustainability Tracker: Visualize campaign performance over a 6-month period using interactive Bar Charts (powered by Swift Charts). Tracks metrics like the impactScore using the SustainabilityMetric data model.

Education Library: Access a categorized library of essential video lessons (VideoLesson) on topics like CTA optimization, goal setting, and real-time data grounding.

Profile Management: View and edit user details, including username and bio, and track personal metrics like "Generated Assets" and "Community Members" followed.

Chatbot / Human Support: A simulated chat interface for quick Q&A and immediate connection to "human" support associates.

Responsive UI: Fully native, adaptive layout using SwiftUI for optimal performance on all iOS devices.

ðŸ’» Technology Stack
Language: Swift 5.0+

Frameworks:

SwiftUI: For building the entire declarative user interface.

Foundation: For core data types and utility functions.

Charts: For data visualization in the TrackerView (e.g., BarMark).

Platform: iOS 16.0+ (Requires Charts framework)

Development Environment: Xcode

ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run and build this application, you must have Xcode installed on a macOS machine.

Prerequisites

macOS (running a recent version)

Xcode (version 14.0 or later for SwiftUI Charts support)

Installation and Setup

Clone the Repository:

git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
cd AI-Marketing-Support-App

Open in Xcode:
Open the project file (.xcodeproj or .xcworkspace) in Xcode.

Select a Simulator:
Choose an iPhone or iPad simulator (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro) from the device selector at the top of the Xcode window.

Build and Run:
Press the Run button (or âŒ˜ + R). Xcode will compile the Swift and SwiftUI code and launch the app in the selected simulator.

ðŸ“Š Data Structure Highlight
The SustainabilityMetric struct, which powers the tracker's visualization, is defined as follows:

struct SustainabilityMetric: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let month: String
    let impactScore: Int // A score out of 100
}

This simple structure allows for easy iteration and mapping within the SwiftUI Chart view to display historical performance data.
